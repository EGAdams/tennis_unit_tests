    <h1>Edge Case Testing Strategy</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The following document outlines the edge case testing strategy for the C++ code provided. Edge case testing ensures
        that software behaves as expected even in extreme or unanticipated situations.
    </p>

    <h2>Test Scenarios</h2>
    <h3>1. TestFirstScore:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Checks the initial scores for both players.</li>
        <li>Increments the score for player 1 and verifies the updated score on the scoreboard.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. TestPlayerPointsEqualOpponentPoints:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tests behavior when both players have the same score.</li>
        <li>Both players' scores are set to 3 and the updated scores on the scoreboard are verified.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. TestPlayerWinsGame:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Simulates a scenario where player 1 wins a game.</li>
        <li>Player 1's score is set to 5, and player 2's score is set to 3.</li>
        <li>Verifies that the game count for player 1 is incremented.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. TestMode1P1Score_3Points:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Checks the behavior when player 1 has a score of 3 and player 2 has a score of 2.</li>
        <li>Verifies the scores on the scoreboard and ensures they match the expected format.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. TestDeuceScenario:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Simulates the scenario when both players have a score leading to "deuce".</li>
        <li>Both players' scores are set to 3 and the scoreboard is verified to reflect the deuce.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. TestWinAfterAdvantage:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Verifies the scenario when a player wins after gaining an advantage following a deuce.</li>
        <li>Player 1 is given the advantage and then scores another point to win the game.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        This testing strategy aims to cover all potential edge cases in the game scoring system. By ensuring thorough
        testing, we can confidently present to investors that our software is robust, reliable, and handles all possible
        game scenarios appropriately.
