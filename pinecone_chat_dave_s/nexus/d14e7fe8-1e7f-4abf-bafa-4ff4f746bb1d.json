The purpose of this strategy is to ensure that the code is thoroughly tested and that all edge cases are covered. By following this strategy, we can demonstrate to investors that our software is reliable and robust.\n </p>\n <h2>Test Coverage</h2>\n <p>\n The unit tests for \"Mode1Score.cpp\" cover various scenarios and edge cases to ensure that the code functions correctly in all situations. The following sections outline the specific tests that have been implemented.\n </p>\n <h3>TestFirstScore</h3>\n <p>\n This test verifies that the player scores are initially set to 0 and that the score is correctly updated when the player's score is incremented. It checks the expected output of the score board after the update.\n </p>\n <h3>TestPlayerPointsEqualOpponentPoints</h3>\n <p>\n This test ensures that the code handles the scenario where both players have the same number of points. It sets both players' points to 3 and checks that the points are",
