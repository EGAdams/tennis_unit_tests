  "message": "Certainly! Let's discuss some edge case tests that can be included in the testing strategy for the provided C++ code. These tests will help ensure that the code functions correctly in various scenarios and handle all possible edge cases.\n1. TestFirstScore:\n - This test case verifies that when the first player scores a point, the score is correctly updated on the score board.\n - It checks that the player's points are incremented by 1 and the opponent's points remain unchanged.\n - The expected score board output is also checked to ensure it matches the expected format.\n2. TestPlayerPointsEqualOpponentPoints:\n - This test case checks the behavior when both players have the same number of points.\n - It sets both players' points to 3 and verifies that the points are correctly updated on the score board.\n - The expected score board output is checked to ensure it reflects the equal points scenario.\n3. TestPlayerWinsGame:\n - This test case simulates a scenario where one player wins a game.\n - It sets the first player's points to 5 and the second player's points to 3.\n - The updateScore method is called, and it is verified that the first player's games are incremented by 1 and the second player's games remain unchanged.\n4. TestMode1P1Score_3Points:\n - This test case checks the behavior when the first player has 3 points and the second player has 2 points.\n - It verifies that the points are correctly updated on the score board and that the expected score board output matches the expected format.\n5. TestDeuceScenario:\n - This test case simulates a scenario where both players reach a score of 40, resulting in a \"deuce\" situation.\n - It sets both players' points to 3 and verifies that the score board reflects the deuce scenario.\n - It then updates the score to give the first player the advantage and checks",
