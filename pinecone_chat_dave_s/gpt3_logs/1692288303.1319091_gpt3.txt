Please think about some edge case tests and create a document that we can use to show investors that we have a solid testing strategy.

Output html only please.
Thank you very much.  Now will you please put your output in html?
Certainly! I will now generate an HTML document that showcases the edge case tests and our solid testing strategy. Please give me a moment to generate the document for you.
USER: I did not get the document.  Will you please genterate the document?



I will now provide a long, detailed, verbose response.:

 <h1>Unit Test Strategy</h1>
 <h2>Introduction</h2>
 <p>
 This document outlines the unit testing strategy for the C++ file "Mode1Score.cpp" and its corresponding test file "Mode1ScoreTest.cpp". The purpose of this strategy is to ensure that the code is thoroughly tested and that all edge cases are covered. By following this strategy, we can demonstrate to investors that our software is reliable and robust.
 </p>
 <h2>Test Coverage</h2>
 <p>
 The unit tests for "Mode1Score.cpp" cover various scenarios and edge cases to ensure that the code functions correctly in all situations. The following sections outline the specific tests that have been implemented.
 </p>
 <h3>TestFirstScore</h3>
 <p>
 This test verifies that the player scores are initially set to 0 and that the score is correctly updated when the player's score is incremented. It checks the expected output of the score board after the update.
