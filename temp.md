Based on the provided files, it seems that you are trying to build a unit test for the `PinInterface` class using Google Test and Google Mock. Here are a few potential issues and suggested fixes:

1. Issue: Missing include guards in `MockPinInterface.cpp`.
   Fix: Add include guards at the beginning and end of the file:
   ```cpp
   #ifndef MOCKPININTERFACE_CPP
   #define MOCKPININTERFACE_CPP

   // Existing code...

   #endif // MOCKPININTERFACE_CPP
   ```

2. Issue: Missing include directives in `MockPinInterface.cpp`.
   Fix: Add the necessary include directives at the beginning of the file:
   ```cpp
   #include "MockPinInterface.h"
   #include "PinInterface.h"
   #include <gmock/gmock.h>
   ```

3. Issue: Missing include directive in `PinInterface.cpp`.
   Fix: Add the necessary include directive at the beginning of the file:
   ```cpp
   #include "PinInterface.h"
   ```

4. Issue: Incorrect include directive in `PinInterface.h`.
   Fix: Update the include directive for `PinState.h` to use the correct relative path:
   ```cpp
   #include "../PinState/PinState.h"
   ```

5. Issue: Missing implementation for the `PinState` class.
   Fix: Make sure you have the necessary implementation for the `PinState` class in a separate file, and include it in the appropriate files (`PinInterface.cpp` and `MockPinInterface.cpp`).

6. Issue: Missing build instructions for Google Test and Google Mock dependencies in the `Makefile`.
   Fix: Uncomment the build instructions for Google Test and Google Mock dependencies in the `Makefile` by removing the leading `#` characters before the build commands.

Once you have made these fixes, you can try building and running the unit tests using the provided `Makefile`.
